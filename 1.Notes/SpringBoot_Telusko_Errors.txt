1.Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'com.example.demo.Alien' available
	at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBean(DefaultListableBeanFactory.java:351)
Reason:In JVM, we have a Spring container, that contains objects which are called Spring Beans.
	this line creates the Spring container/ this is when it initialises your container: ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(FirstProjApplication.class, args);

Solution: 	By writing @Component (and import) in the class we specify to the Spring that we want objects of only these classes in spring container i.e as Spring beans.
	It will be present in the Spring container and then you can use it: Alien a = context.getBean(Alien.class);
	(This is DI)
